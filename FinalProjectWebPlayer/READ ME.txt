This unity environment is a Prison Break scenario. There are two types of NPCs: prisoners and guards. Prisoners are orange and are trying to escape the prison. To do this they follow a path and have to avoid guards and spotlights to avoid getting caught. If they get caught by a guard or spotlight, they are sent back to the jailcell. The guards are blue and follow one of three patrol paths. If a prisoner gets near them they stray from their patrol path and try to catch the prisoner while the prisoner is still close to them. The spotlights search through set areas and they don't stray from their set path. Both the prisoners and guards are contained within the prison fences.
The only controls for the user is that you can cycle through 5 set cameras by pressing 'C'. Two of the camers follow one of the two prisoners while the other three observe one of the sides of three sides of the prison.
